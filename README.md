### üßë‚Äçüíª User Registration and KYC

This module allows users to register on the platform securely using a unique email and password. After registration, users are prompted to complete **KYC (Know Your Customer)** verification, which includes uploading identification documents (like Aadhaar or Passport), a profile picture, and other relevant details. This process ensures user authenticity and compliance with platform policies. The system validates uploaded files, checks data consistency, and updates the user‚Äôs KYC status to *Pending*, *Approved*, or *Rejected* based on admin verification.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Account Creation

Once users complete KYC, they can proceed to **account creation**, where they can set up their personalized dashboard or profile based on the application requirements. This process leverages **Django** on the backend for managing models and data integrity, while **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** are used to create interactive and responsive forms. Data interaction is handled using Django‚Äôs **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper)**, ensuring smooth database operations like user data storage, validation, and retrieval.
